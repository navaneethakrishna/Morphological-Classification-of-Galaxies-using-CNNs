# Morphological-Classification-of-Galaxies-using-CNNs
This is an after-termination attempt at the Galaxy Zoo - The Galaxy Challenge which was hosted on Kaggle. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify galaxies according to their morphology. 
The files in this repository are:
1. README.md - Please read this for an overarching description
2. Background - This file gives a brief description of the Galaxy Zoo Project and introduces the challenge and its objective
3. POSTER - This is the poster which was made as a part of the presentation of the project
4. Code - Python code in a Jupyter Notebook
5. FLOW-DAIGRAM - This is an image depecting the flow of questions according to the previous answer
